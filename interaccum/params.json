As well, please let me know about your uses of this data and send manuscripts and reprints when available. I´ll be happy to help you in any case, as far as I can.\r\n\r\nI am periodically updating this data base since I started writing my PhD thesis more than 10 years ago. Thus, I´d like to receive suggestions for new data sources and provide updated versions to those interested.\r\n\r\nPlease, use these data files for peaceful purposes, enjoy doing science with them as I have enjoyed writing the paper quoted above, and learn as much as you can with them. They are the result of splendid work by many people working with plant-frugivore interactions and are embedded in papers reporting very interesting results, descriptions and discussions on these interactions; please read them.\r\n\r\n\r\n### CONTACTING\r\n\r\nContact me at:\r\n\r\nPedro Jordano\r\n\r\nEstación Biológica de Doñana, CSIC\r\n\r\nAv.

I've benefited from the help of Myriam Márquez, who aided carefully with data checking several times. Carlos M. Herrera helped with unpublished data and by providing literature sources; his advice and comments were always invaluable. F.H.J. Crome also provided his original data just at the start of this project. Comments and advice from Paulo R. Guimarães Jr., Mauro Galetti, H. Martin Schaefer and Alfredo Valido were very helpful for the 2008 version. Computer time and facilities were kindly provided by the Centro de Informatica Cientifica de Andalucia. Financial support was from the Spanish Direccion General de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnica, projects PB-87-0452 and PB-91-0114.\r\n\r\n\r\n### HISTORY\r\n\r\nversion 1.- 16 April 1983. Only 219 species.\r\nversion 1.5 - 23 December 1991. Added many species with information on fruit size only and completed the literature survey up to 1991.\r\nversion 1.9 - 4 May 1994. Prepared the first version of this package. Recoding of the reference numbers to accomodate the inclusion of the appendix.\r\nversion 2.0 - 12 January 1995. Added the SUMMARY file and minor changes to this file.\r\n\r\nversion 2.5 - 8 July 2001. First draft of the web page.\r\n\r\nversion 3.0 - A major update to the dataset, adding new variables such as fruit color, growth habit, etc. Major addition of species. Started revision 12 Feb 2003.\r\n\r\nversion 4.0 - A major update to the dataset, with revision of the taxonomic arrangement according to: Stevens, P. F. (2001 onwards). Angiosperm Phylogeny Website. Version 8, June 2007. http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/. This scheme follows: A.P.G. [= Angiosperm Phylogeny Group] II. 2003.
